#Creting an instance on linode using terraform


# Make a Terraform project directory in your home directory and then navigate to it:

mkdir ~/terraform
cd ~/terraform

# install terraform
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

# Download the terraform download file from Terraform’s website , ensuring that the latest version available is being installed.
# The 64-bit Linux .zip archive
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.1.9/terraform_1.1.9_linux_amd64.zip

# Import the HashiCorp Security GPG key 34365D9472D7468F
gpg --recv-keys 34365D9472D7468F

# Verify the checksum file’s GPG signature:
gpg --verify terraform*.sig terraform*SHA256SUMS

# Verify the .zip archive’s checksum:
sha256sum -c terraform*SHA256SUMS 2>&1 | grep OK

terraform_1.1.9_linux_amd64.zip: OK

# Configure the Terraform Environment
Unzip terraform_*_linux_amd64.zip to your ~/terraform directory:

unzip terraform_*_linux_amd64.zip
# Edit your ~./profile to include the ~/terraform directory in your PATH. Then, reload the Bash profile:

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/terraform"' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile

# Verify Terraform can run by simply calling it with no options or arguments:
terraform 

# Building the linode instance
# create a main.tf file in your terraform directory/folder
nano main.tf

# paste the following
terraform {
  required_providers {
    linode = {
      source = "linode/linode"
      version = "1.27.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "linode" {
  token = "YOUR_LINODE_API_TOKEN"
}

resource "linode_instance" "terraform-web" {
        label = "emediong-linode-test-project "
        group = "Terraform"
        region = "us-east"
        type = "g6-standard-1"
        authorized_keys = [ "YOUR_PUBLIC_SSH_KEY" ]
        root_pass = "YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD"
}
# Fill in your Linode API token, public SSH key, and desired root password where indicated. Additionally, replace the Linode provider version to the latest as well as the label:

# Initialize the Terraform configuration:
terraform init

# Note
# If an error occurs, run the command again in debug mode:
TF_LOG=debug terraform init

# Run Terraform’s plan command:
terraform plan

# Next run 
terraform apply

You are asked to confirm the action. Enter yes and press Enter:
# Visit the Linode Manager. You should see that your Linode instance has been added to your account.
Hope you had a nice time terraforming , cheers.
